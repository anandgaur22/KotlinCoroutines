ðŸš€ Kotlin Coroutines & Suspend Functions - Explained
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Kotlin Coroutines in an Android application to handle background tasks efficiently. It covers:
âœ… Coroutine Scopes (viewModelScope, lifecycleScope, GlobalScope)
âœ… Coroutine Builders (launch, async)
âœ… Suspending Functions (suspend keyword)
âœ… Coroutine Dispatchers (Dispatchers.Main, Dispatchers.IO, Dispatchers.Default, Dispatchers.Unconfined)
âœ… Exception Handling in Coroutines
âœ… Kotlin Flow for Real-Time Updates

ðŸ”¹ Coroutine Scopes
Types of Coroutine Scopes:
viewModelScope â€“ Best for UI-related tasks inside a ViewModel (Auto-cancels on ViewModel clear).
lifecycleScope â€“ Best for activities/fragments (Cancels when lifecycle reaches onDestroy).
GlobalScope â€“ Used for long-running tasks (Not recommended for UI, as it runs for app lifetime).

ðŸ”¹ Coroutine Builders: launch vs async
launch { } â†’ Fire-and-forget, does not return a result (Used for background tasks).
async { } â†’ Returns Deferred<T>, which allows fetching a result asynchronously.

ðŸ”¹ Suspend Functions & suspend Keyword
suspend is a modifier that marks a function as a suspending function.
Suspending functions can be paused and resumed without blocking threads.
They must be called inside a coroutine or another suspending function.

ðŸ”¹ Coroutine Dispatchers
Types of Dispatchers:
Dispatchers.Main â†’ Runs on the Main Thread (UI-related work)
Dispatchers.IO â†’ Used for network/database operations (Background tasks)
Dispatchers.Default â†’ Used for CPU-intensive tasks (Heavy computations)
Dispatchers.Unconfined â†’ Starts on the caller thread, but may continue in a different thread
